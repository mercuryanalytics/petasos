# MercurySsoAuth0
Short description and motivation.

## Usage

Create an initializer in your app add set the following values:
```ruby
MercurySsoAuth0.setup do |ma|
  ma.client    = 'AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
  ma.secret    = 'AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
  ma.domain    = 'AUTH0_DOMAIN'
  ma.login_url = 'BASE_URL FOR FRONTEND RAM APP'
  ma.api_url   = 'API_BASE_URL'
  # this will be app url which also needs to be in auth0 authorized callbacks
  # in auth0 authorized callbacks, the URL must also contain `auth/auth0/callback` path
  ma.host      = 'https://domain.tld' 
                  
end
```

Include the following in your protected controllers:
```
class ProtectedControllerBase < ApplicationController
  include MercurySsoAuth0::Authenticated
end
```


Defined methods:
* `current_user` returns the current authenticated user as a `MercurySsoAuth0::User` instance
* `MercurySsoAuth0::User#email` -  returns the email
* `MercurySsoAuth0::User#scopes(session || {})`
    * sends a GET request to RAM Api and saves the returned scopes in session or a simple hash or a hash structure of your choice (you can also cache it through Rails.cache)
    * you can use this in your cancancan ability files to assign permissions
    * in order to not call the api again, you can save the scopes in session or a hash structure

Sample of scopes you can get:

You can use the `dynamic` key to set your cancan abilities. A sample file would be

Notes: 
* The format of the response is the following:
```
{
"data": {
    "DIMENSION": [
        authorization_as_json, 
        [ram access - viewer, DIMENSIOÎ©N_access, DIMENSION_admin, DIMENSION_editor],
        [Dynamic Scopes for this authorization]
    ],
    "global": [array of global scopes for this user],
    "dynamic": [array of dynamic scopes]
}

}
```

* Current dimensions are: `project, report, client`
* If you need to check if a user has access to a specific report, you can iterate through the "DIMENSION" - look at the example of `sample of scopes`

* user_ability.rb
```
class UserAbility
  include CanCan::Ability

  attr_reader :user

  def initialize(user, session)
    @user = user
    
    # setting the admin
    can :manage, :all if @user.scopes(session)['data']['global'].any? { |permission| permission['action'] == 'admin' }

    # Setting the dynamic access
    @user.scopes(session)['data']['dynamic'].each do |permission|
       can permission['action'].to_sym, Model
    end
  end
end
```

* users_controller.rb
```
class UsersController < ApplicationController

  def index
    can? :permission_name, User
  end

  def current_ability
    UserAbility.new(current_user, session)
  end
end
```

# Generating scopes
## Generating dynamic scopes
Use the following rake task in the RAM api to generate new dynamic scopes

`bundle exec rake scopes:create -- --action do --scope reports --description \"Some description\" --name name`

OR use the following SQL query

`INSERT INTO scopes(scope, action, description, dynamic, name, created_at, updated_at) VALUES('reports', 'doSomething', 'Some description of your new scope', true, 'Primary name', NOW(), NOW());`

This will create a new scope scope which will be added as a checkbox under Report tab in RAM SuperAdmin, in which you can enable / disable it.
Note: for dynamic scopes, in order for them to appear in the RAM UI, its scope must be one of `clients, reports, projects`

## Generating global scopes
You can use the following query to generate a global scope:

`INSERT INTO scopes(scope, action, description, global, name, created_at, updated_at) VALUES('admin', 'doSomething', 'Some description of your new scope', true, 'Primary name', NOW(), NOW());`
 
## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mercury_sso_auth0'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install mercury_sso_auth0
```
